//! How a client reaches a server's endpoints, as `PROTOCOL.md`'s Transport says: HTTP over TCP,
//! or one HTTP/2 connection over the server's stdin and stdout; and what every endpoint's client
//! shares on it: a JSON request and its refusal ([`http`]), a job's log as an event stream
//! ([`sse`], whose server end keeps the log too), and the files of a volume or a sandbox over
//! WebDAV ([`webdav`]).
//!
//! The client end is the `client` feature, the server end the `server` feature; the types
//! [`webdav`]'s requests name are always built.
