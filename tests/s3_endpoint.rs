//! A real object-store endpoint, driven through [`S3Fs::new`].
//!
//! Exercises the client `S3Fs::new` builds from an [`S3Config`] (credentials, endpoint,
//! path addressing, SigV4) and the wire format under it: `ListObjectsV2` XML, a ranged
//! `GET`, a `HEAD`, and error status codes, none of which a local stand-in produces.
//!
//! Skipped, not failed, when the host cannot be reached, so a suite without network stays
//! green.
