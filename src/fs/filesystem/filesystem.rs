/// A logical, path-addressed store that can be exposed as a filesystem.
///
/// A *description* of a tree: nothing about it is visible outside this process until a binding
/// puts it behind a real filesystem interface, yielding a [`Mount`](crate::fs::Mount).
///
/// Every operation names its target by path, in two planes: the namespace
/// (`stat`/`list`/`create`/`mkdir`/`unlink`/`rmdir`/`rename`) and the bytes
/// (`read_at`/`write_at`/`truncate`/`flush`). Nothing stands between a caller and either:
///
/// * The trait stays object-safe, so a mount table holds mixed backends as `dyn FileSystem`.
/// * It matches the wire: the console's `read`/`write` carry path, offset and length, so a
///   remote backend forwards calls instead of keeping bookkeeping on each end.
/// * Most backends have no per-open state; their bytes are reachable by path, and an open
///   handle would only return a slice of a cache they already hold.
///
/// # No opens, only paths
///
/// Nothing here is a descriptor: no handle, no id to key state by, no "last close", no `open`.
/// A POSIX open decomposes into what a store does have: `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` is
/// [`create`](Self::create) (the only exclusive way to make a name), `O_TRUNC` is
/// [`truncate`](Self::truncate), and the rest is bookkeeping in the layer that has
/// descriptors. So a backend author (document API, object store, database) never reasons about
/// an identity POSIX invented.
///
/// That identity lives in the layer that has descriptors, which keeps one alive past its name's
/// unlink (as NFS does) without any backend knowing.
///
/// A backend must not keep that state itself: a path names a file, not an open of it, and POSIX
/// lets a name be unlinked and recreated while an earlier open is still written. Path-keyed
/// state would then silently serve the second file's bytes to the first open's reads.
///
/// # Three methods are required; everything that mutates refuses by default
///
/// [`stat`](Self::stat), [`list`](Self::list) and [`read_at`](Self::read_at) have no default.
/// Every mutating method defaults to [`ReadOnlyFilesystem`], so a read-only backend (object
/// store, page API) implements just the three. A writable backend that forgets one answers
/// `EROFS` loudly on first use instead of failing silently.
///
/// [`ReadOnlyFilesystem`]: io::ErrorKind::ReadOnlyFilesystem
///
/// # Durability
///
/// **A write is durable when it returns.** [`write_at`](Self::write_at) answers once the store
/// has the bytes, since no signal says a caller is done. A backend that must batch does so on
/// its own terms (size threshold, timer).
///
/// [`flush`](Self::flush) makes what is written to a name durable *now*, giving a guest's
/// `fsync` somewhere to land instead of a silent `Ok`.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// [`io::Error`], classified by [`kind`](io::Error::kind) rather than errno: kinds carry every
/// distinction this crate needs, `std::fs` errors keep their message and `source`, and a
/// backend client's error wraps with `io::Error::other` instead of being flattened.
///
/// Three are easy to get wrong, and userspace acts on the difference:
///
/// * [`ReadOnlyFilesystem`] (`EROFS`) is a store that could write and will not;
///   [`Unsupported`] is `ENOSYS`, "not implemented at all". `cp`, `rsync` and editors handle
///   the first and read the second as a broken filesystem. `ENOSYS` also does *not* stop a
///   kernel asking: a Linux guest over virtio-fs keeps sending `mkdir`, `unlink`, `rmdir`,
///   `rename` and `write` after it.
/// * [`CrossesDevices`] (`EXDEV`) makes `mv`, `rsync` and editors copy then delete, so naming
///   it precisely lets a cross-backend move *succeed*.
/// * [`PermissionDenied`] (`EACCES`) is skipped by `find`/`rsync`/`tar`, which abort on `EIO`;
///   collapsing the two loses a whole traversal to one unreadable file.
///
/// A consumer translating these for a kernel classifies by `kind`; forwarding
/// [`raw_os_error`](io::Error::raw_os_error) suits only a host mount, which shares this
/// process's numbering, never a guest.
///
/// [`Unsupported`]: io::ErrorKind::Unsupported
/// [`CrossesDevices`]: io::ErrorKind::CrossesDevices
/// [`PermissionDenied`]: io::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied
///
/// # Async
///
/// Both planes are naturally async (object store, document API). An async-native consumer
/// (WebDAV/HTTP frontend) `.await`s directly; a sync binding (fuse/fuse-t) `block_on`s at its
/// callback boundary.
///
/// A backend on blocking `std::fs` or a lock stalls the executor worker; an async frontend over
/// one wraps calls in `tokio::task::block_in_place` (multi-thread runtime only; free when the
/// call is quick) rather than `spawn_blocking`.
///
/// # Boxed futures
///
/// Every method returns a [`BoxFuture`]: the trait is held as `dyn` (a mount table keeps
/// backends of different types behind one pointer), and an `async fn` in a trait returns a type
/// a `dyn` cannot name. That is one allocation per call, against a syscall or round trip.
/// Written out rather than via `#[async_trait]`, so the lifetimes are visible where the borrows
/// are.
///
/// Each method binds its borrows and future to one lifetime, so `path` and `buf` may be
/// shorter-lived than the backend, as they usually are: the buffer belongs to the request.
///
