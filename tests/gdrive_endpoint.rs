//! A Drive API that this repository does not write, driven through [`GdriveFs::new`].
//!
//! The loopback mock in `gdrive_tests.rs` encodes our reading of the API, so it agrees with
//! us by construction and stays green when the API moves. This suite asks **whether what we
//! ask for is what Drive answers**, against **backlot** (`brekkylab/enterprise-mock`), which
//! follows the real Drive, Docs, Sheets and Slides shapes over a corpus: paging cursors,
//! `orderBy`, the ACL-filtered view a token sees, the error statuses Google returns.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test --features gdrive --test gdrive_endpoint -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Credentials come from backlot's token roster at `/_mock/users`, so no secret is kept;
//! skipped, not failed, when the host cannot be reached. Not covered: the span policy (both
//! spans exceed every corpus file) and request counts or `Range` headers, which only the
//! loopback mock sees.
