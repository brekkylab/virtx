//! One module per concrete filesystem interface, each binding it to the layer below.
//!
//! A binding only translates: decode the interface's arguments, call a shared operation,
//! encode the reply. It decides only the errno numbering its consumer expects (a guest kernel
//! is always Linux; the host's is the host's) and the attribute type it fills.
//!
//! Each binding exports a guard whose `try_new` mounts, `join` waits for the mount to end, and
//! `Drop` takes it down, plus its mount options; vtables, callbacks and session handles stay
//! private.
