//! The two ends of a console, and the wire between them.
//!
//! A *console server* speaks JSON-RPC over stdio and runs commands somewhere: this
//! host, a micro-VM, wherever. A *console client* drives one. Servers differ only in
//! that "somewhere"; the methods, which end may ask what, and request/response pairing
//! are defined once here so servers cannot drift apart on them.
//!
//! - [`Client`] and [`Server`] — what each end does on a channel, independent of
//!   transport: a client only asks, a server only answers, and neither reads meaning into
//!   a message (where a command runs, what a session allows, when something has booted).
//! - [`Message`] and the methods, errors and payloads both ends agree on.
//! - [`stdio`] — the current transport; another (e.g. a micro-VM's virtio port) would
//!   change nothing above it.
//! - [`ConsoleClient`](crate::console::ConsoleClient) — the public end: the channel driving a
//!   server, plus the session it was opened with.
//!
//! A server never issues a request, so neither end needs a pending table, a listener, or
//! a reader that must not block on work only it can unblock.
//!
//! # The wire
//!
//! Every [`Message`] is a JSON-RPC 2.0 object, shown here as BSON Extended JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"exec","params":{"cmd":["sh","-c","ls"]}}
//! {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"exec","result":{"code":0,"stdout":<Binary>,"stderr":<Binary>,"truncated":false}}
//! {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"error":{"code":-32000,"message":"timed out after 1000ms"}}
//! {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"quit"}
//! ```
//!
//! **The object model is the spec's; the encoding is not.** Member presence decides a
//! message's shape, `id` pairs a response with its request, and the error codes are
//! JSON-RPC 2.0's. The bytes are BSON documents; framing is [`stdio`]'s.
//!

//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - **Booting is not a method.** Anything that needs a booted session boots one, so
//!   [`Start`](Notification::Start) and [`Stop`](Notification::Stop) are resource
//!   management only and go unanswered. `init` is a call because it says what the session
//!   *is*, and its answer is the first thing a client can act on.
//! - **Failure is an `error` with a code**, the only failure channel: a requester branches
//!   on [`Error::code`], and an `error` cannot be mistaken for a command's exit status.
//! - **An execution is one request and one response, never a stream.** The caller is an
//!   agent that cannot act on partial output, so [`ExecResp`] arrives whole, bounded by
//!   [`MAX_PAYLOAD`]. It takes no stdin (stage files with `write`, collect them with
//!   `read`), and a command that never ends needs [`timeout_ms`](ExecCall::timeout_ms).
//! - **Program bytes are bytes; names are text.** Output and file contents are raw bytes;
//!   an argv and a path are UTF-8, since both ends must interpret them.
//!
//! ## Why the codec is BSON
//!
//! **Self-describing.** `{"method":..,"params":..}` is serde adjacent tagging, and
//! `result` xor `error` is decided by which member is *present*; both need a deserializer
//! that can look ahead, which postcard and bincode cannot.
//!
//! **A byte type.** Exec output and file contents are most of the traffic and are program
//! bytes, not text. JSON would need base64 (1.33×, plus decoding); BSON's `Binary`
//! carries them as themselves.
//!
//! ### What that costs
//!
//! An off-the-shelf JSON-RPC library: a peer needs a BSON codec. That matters little,
//! since such a peer already needs bespoke framing and both ends live in this workspace.
//!
//! Not frame size where it matters. BSON writes array indices as keys (`cmd` becomes
//! `{"0":"ls"}`) and names as C strings, so a control frame like `stop` is slightly
//! *larger* than JSON; the large, frequent output frames shrink. MessagePack and CBOR
//! beat BSON on both; BSON wins on being self-delimiting (which can retire the framing
//! layer) and on `doc!`/Extended JSON keeping the wire readable to people and tests.
//!
//! # Every trait method hands back a boxed future
//!
//! Everything that waits is a future, so one runtime can drive many consoles at a task
//! each rather than a thread parked on a pipe each. An `async fn` in a trait returns a
//! type a `dyn` cannot name, and a [`ConsoleClient`](crate::console::ConsoleClient) holds
//! a `dyn Client` so the transport stays out of its type. A [`BoxFuture`] costs one
//! allocation per call, negligible against a pipe round trip; derived methods use the
//! same shape.
//!
//! Futures and both ends are [`Send`] so a session can be handed to a task.
